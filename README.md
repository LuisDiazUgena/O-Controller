# Oh-Controller
3D Printed controller with ble

##UNDER REALLY REALLY EARLY DEVELOPMENT


## Hardware	

It work with a rotary encoder and an 8x8 led matrix. Led Matrix uses LedControl library [https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl]

## To-Do

Fix bad behaviour of rotary encoder due to animation of led matrix.
Include BLE code to handle communication with computer.
Create BLE code to recieve communication from Arduino BLE.
